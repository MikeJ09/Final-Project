# A Data Analysis on the Potential Effects of Neonicotinoids and Honey Bees

Over the years there have been claims that Neonicotinoids are killing off bees. Studies have suggested that the pesticides are outright killing them 
whereas, some are claiming that they kill them over an extended perioid of time. In this project I will do some analysis to see what I can deduce from the data.

## Getting Started
When you click on the prject, the code and write ups should display. If the graphs do not then there should be a circular icon on the top right
and if you hover over it, it would say "Limited rendering only, external view available with nbviewer". Click on that and then it should open a new tab and from there everything should be there. 

## Exploring the results
There are graphs after almost every block of code. Most of these graphs are interactive. I have writeups after every graph to summerize the main take away
from that particular graph. If you are intrested you can hover over points to get specific results. Some graphs have pre-selected date ranges you can click on,
and others are animated, so you can just click play. There are some graphs where you can't interact with but, as mentioned previously there are a few sentences
after the graph explaining them. Also, they are not interactive beacuse they really do not need to be, they display the point being made clear enough as it is without animation.

## Folder Organization
Included in this repo is the .ipynb which is the actual project, next there is the final powerpoint, and then there is the final report as a pdf.
